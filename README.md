# FishingFrenzy
Custom copy of the game Fishing Frenzy I developed for Rutgers COGS (Creation of Games Society).

The original game is between 2-4 players, each on controller. The goal is to capture as many fish as you can before the clock runs out. I customized this version to be only two players, with keyboard controls. I also made my own version of the game art as this is my own copy.
