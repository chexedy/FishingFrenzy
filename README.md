# FishingFrenzy
Custom copy of the game Fishing Frenzy I developed for Rutgers COGS (Creation of Games Society).

The original game is between 2-4 players, each on controller. The goal is to capture as many fish as you can before the clock runs out. I customized this version to be only two players, with keyboard controls. 

# Playing the Game
You can play the game on itch.io [here]([https://chexedy.github.io/](https://chexedy.itch.io/fishing-frenzy)).
